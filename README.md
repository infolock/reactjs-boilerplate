### Why Another Boilerplate?
@See What Is *NOT* Included (above)

### WTF, Why No Unit Tests?
Unit tests were not included because there is no 1 solution that is perfect, nor is there one set that everyone agrees on.  That being said, it is up to you (the developer(s)) to decide this for yourself.

If you're looking for a great discussion on this topic, there was one started on the reactjs.org boards which you can find here: https://discuss.reactjs.org/t/whats-the-prefered-way-to-test-react-js-components/26

Me personally, I found this article as a great place to get started: https://www.toptal.com/react/how-react-components-make-ui-testing-easy

There are other _great_ resources as well.  Google searching "react unit test examples" is a great place to start.
